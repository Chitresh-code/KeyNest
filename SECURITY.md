## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure Process

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email us** at gychitresh1280@gmail.com
2. **Include the following information:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if you have one)
   - Your contact information

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability type** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Location** of the affected source code (file paths, line numbers)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof-of-concept** or exploit code (if available)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could achieve

### ⏰ Response Timeline

We commit to:

- **Acknowledge** receipt within **24 hours**
- **Initial assessment** within **72 hours**
- **Regular updates** on our investigation progress
- **Resolution timeline** based on severity assessment

### 🏆 Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- **Credited** in our security advisories (if desired)
- **Listed** in our Hall of Fame
- **Eligible** for our bug bounty program (when available)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

KeyNest implements multiple layers of security:

### 🔐 Data Protection

- **AES-256 encryption** for all environment variables at rest
- **TLS/HTTPS** for all data in transit
- **Hashed passwords** using industry-standard algorithms
- **Encrypted database** connections

### 🔑 Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT tokens** with configurable expiration
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- **Multi-factor authentication** (planned)
- **Session management** with secure defaults

### 🌐 Network Security

- **CORS protection** with configurable origins
- **CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- **Input validation** and sanitization

### 🖥️ Infrastructure Security

- **Container security** with minimal base images
- **Secret management** with environment variables
- **Database security** with parameterized queries
- **Audit logging** for all security-relevant events

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Use **HTTPS** in production
- [ ] Set **secure environment variables**
- [ ] Configure **strong database passwords**
- [ ] Enable **audit logging**
- [ ] Set up **monitoring and alerting**
- [ ] Regularly **update dependencies**
- [ ] Use **secure Docker configurations**
- [ ] Implement **backup strategies**

### Environment Variables

Ensure these security-related environment variables are properly configured:

```bash
# Django Security
SECRET_KEY=your-strong-secret-key
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com

# Database Security
DB_PASSWORD=strong-database-password
DB_SSL_REQUIRE=True

# JWT Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-jwt-secret
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME=15  # minutes
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME=7  # days

# Encryption
FERNET_KEY=your-fernet-encryption-key

# Email Security
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_USE_SSL=True
```

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Session Management**
   - No automatic session invalidation on password change
   - JWT tokens cannot be revoked before expiration

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Logs are stored locally (consider external logging service)
   - No log integrity verification

3. **Input Validation**
   - File upload restrictions may need strengthening
   - Consider implementing additional input sanitization

### Planned Improvements

- **Multi-factor authentication** implementation
- **Advanced audit logging** with integrity checks
- **Token revocation** mechanism
- **Enhanced monitoring** and alerting
- **Security headers** implementation
- **Content Security Policy** configuration

## 🛠️ Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

We recommend running these security tests regularly:

```bash
# Backend security checks
cd backend
pip install bandit safety
bandit -r .
safety check

# Frontend security checks
cd frontend
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Docker security scanning
docker scout cves local/keynest:latest
```

### Manual Security Testing

Regular security assessments should include:

- **Authentication testing** (login, session management)
- **Authorization testing** (role-based access)
- **Input validation testing** (SQL injection, XSS)
- **API security testing** (rate limiting, CORS)
- **Infrastructure testing** (container security)

## 📊 Security Metrics

We track these security metrics:

- **Time to vulnerability disclosure** response
- **Security patch deployment** time
- **Dependency update** frequency
- **Security test coverage** percentage
- **Failed authentication** attempts

## 📚 Security Resources

### For Developers

- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

### For Users

- **Use strong passwords** with a password manager
- **Enable two-factor authentication** when available
- **Keep your browser updated** for security patches
- **Review access permissions** regularly
- **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## 🆘 Security Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

### Immediate Actions

1. **Assess the scope** of the incident
2. **Contain the threat** if possible
3. **Notify the security team** immediately
4. **Document everything** for investigation

### Communication

- **Internal team** notification within 1 hour
- **User notification** within 24 hours (if user data affected)
- **Public disclosure** after fix is deployed
- **Regulatory reporting** as required by law

### Recovery

- **Deploy security patches** as soon as possible
